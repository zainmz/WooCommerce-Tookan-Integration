# Tookan WooCommerce Integration

This repository contains a Python-based integration between a MultiVendor WooCommerce-based e-commerce website and the Tookan delivery management application. The integration uses a REST API framework to automate the creation of delivery, pickup, and pickup & delivery tasks on Tookan when the status of an order on the e-commerce website changes.

The integration provides numerous advantages for businesses looking to streamline their order fulfillment process and improve customer satisfaction. Real-time updates ensure that both systems have the most up-to-date information, while the elimination of manual data entry reduces the risk of errors and saves time for the fulfillment team. The standardized, platform-agnostic approach of the REST API framework also provides greater flexibility and scalability for the integration.

This repository includes all of the necessary code to be easily customized to meet the specific needs of your business, making it a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.
